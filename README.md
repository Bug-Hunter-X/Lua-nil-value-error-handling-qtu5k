This repository contains a Lua code example demonstrating a common error related to nil values. The file "bug.lua" shows the erroneous code, while "bugSolution.lua" provides a corrected version. The bug arises from the improper handling of a potential nil value passed to the function, resulting in an error. The solution implements more robust error handling, providing better control and avoiding unexpected crashes.
